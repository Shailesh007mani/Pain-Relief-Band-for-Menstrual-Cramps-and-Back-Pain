# Pain-Relief-Band-for-Menstrual-Cramps-and-Back-Pain
The proposed design attempts to answer the customer’s need for a reliable, accurate and comprehensive system that provides them relief from primary dysmenorrhea. FIR (far-infrared radiation) therapy has been used as a treatment. This design introduces an innovative yet simple engineering method in the usage of heat therapy replacing the traditional idea.


It is electronically designed using MCU CC2640R2F, GRAPHENE FAR-INFRARED HEATING FILM, Tourmaline stones which are the piezoelectric. The temperature and other parameters will be controlled by a user through application which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Tourmaline stones are piezoelectric-when they are heated, they produce an electrical potential. They also emit FIR (far infrared) radiation and negative ions, effects that increase when the heat is applied. Hot stones release heat slowly and steadily, gradually softening sore muscles and eliminate tension, help you deeply relax. It can put you into a meditative and healing state. The efficiency shows in terms of high safety measures, low cost of fabrication and usage, resilient as functioning automatically in all-weather conditions with agreeable stability of temperature on the area of patients’ body during treatment.
